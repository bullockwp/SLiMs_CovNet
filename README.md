# SLiMs_CovNet
-"Feature-learning in Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) and Characterizing SLiMs in their Structural Context."  
- Created a convolutional neural network which infers a probability distribution of residues along alternative sequences of SLiMs,  from the input of their atomistic structure.
- 8 week project.
- Intended as a learning exercise in machine learning.

Conclusions:
Working with limited accuracy, strong proof of concept, requires hyperparameter and model tweaking beyond what is avaialble in a limited timeframe.

Implicaitons:
Part of the continued research of Dr. Wouter Krogh Boomsma In machine learning for structural biology informatics.

Credits:
'deepfold' scripts were created by Dr. Wouter Krogh Boomsma (Uni of Copenhagen) and associates.
